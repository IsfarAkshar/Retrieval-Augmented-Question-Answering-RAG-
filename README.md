# Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering (RAG)

This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline that retrieves relevant documents using vector similarity search and generates grounded answers using a transformer-based language model.

## Features
- Sentence embeddings using Sentence Transformers
- FAISS-based semantic retrieval
- LLM-based answer generation (FLAN-T5)
- End-to-end pipeline in Google Colab

## Technologies
- Python
- PyTorch
- Hugging Face Transformers
- FAISS

## Usage
Open the ipynb file in Google Colab and run cells sequentially.
