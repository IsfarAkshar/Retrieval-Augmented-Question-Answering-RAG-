# Retrieval-Augmented-Question-Answering-RAG-
Designed and implemented an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Question Answering system using Sentence Transformers for semantic embeddings, FAISS for efficient vector similarity search, and a transformer-based LLM (FLAN-T5) for grounded answer generation, aiming to reduce hallucination in large language models.
